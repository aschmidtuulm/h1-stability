This repository consists of
* MAPLE code to compute local mass matrices for triangles and quadrilaterals, polynomial degree can be varied
* mass matrices stored as .mat-files for further computation in MATLAB 
* MATLAB code to solve eigenvalue problem as described in [1], polynomial degree and number of hanging nodes can be varied
